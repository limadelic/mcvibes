- NEVER use TypeScript
- NEVER use Python for anything at all!!!
- NEVER go back to a solution the user has already rejected or said they don't like

## Coding Style

- Prefer functional over OOP
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use boolean logic for control flow (e.g., `(test() && commit()) || revert()`)
- Minimal dependencies
- Terse but readable code
- Modern JS features (destructuring, arrow functions, template literals)
- Single responsibility modules
- Clean abstractions over complexity
- Both named and default exports for flexibility
- Simple error handling that doesn't break flow
